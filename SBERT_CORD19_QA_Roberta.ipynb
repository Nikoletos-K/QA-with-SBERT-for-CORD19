        "Let’s start by looking at the architecture of SentenceBERT, which I will call SBERT from here on. SBERT is a so-called twin network which allows it to process two sentences in the same way, simultaneously. These two twins are identical down to every parameter (their weight is tied), which allows us to think about this architecture as a single model used multiple times. (I think the reason for the twin formulation is due to mathematical ease, but I need to read the original paper for figuring it out)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It becomes apparent from the image that BERT makes up the base of this model, to which a pooling layer has been appended. This pooling layer enables us to create a fixed-size representation for input sentences of varying lengths. The authors experimented with different pooling strategies; MEAN- and MAX pooling or utilising the CLS token BERT per default already generates. How these perform and compare will be discussed later.\r\n",
        "Since the purpose of creating these fixed-size sentence embeddings was to encode their semantics did the authors fine-tune their network on Semantic Textual Similarity data. \r\n",
