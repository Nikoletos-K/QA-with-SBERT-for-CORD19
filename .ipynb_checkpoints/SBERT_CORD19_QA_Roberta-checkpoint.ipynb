    "__How does SentenceBERT work?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by looking at the architecture of SentenceBERT, which I will call SBERT from here on. SBERT is a so-called twin network which allows it to process two sentences in the same way, simultaneously. These two twins are identical down to every parameter (their weight is tied), which allows us to think about this architecture as a single model used multiple times. (I think the reason for the twin formulation is due to mathematical ease, but I need to read the original paper for figuring it out)\n",
    "\n",
    "It becomes apparent from the image that BERT makes up the base of this model, to which a pooling layer has been appended. This pooling layer enables us to create a fixed-size representation for input sentences of varying lengths. The authors experimented with different pooling strategies; MEAN- and MAX pooling or utilising the CLS token BERT per default already generates. How these perform and compare will be discussed later.\n",
    "Since the purpose of creating these fixed-size sentence embeddings was to encode their semantics did the authors fine-tune their network on Semantic Textual Similarity data. \n",

    "Generally,\n",

    "__Sentence embeddings__ are a similar concept. It embeds a full sentence into a vector space. These sentence embeddings retain some nice properties, as they inherit features from their underlying word embeddings.\n",
    "There is a huge trend lately for a quest for Universal Embeddings: embeddings that are pre-trained on a large corpus and can be plugged in a variety of downstream task models (sentimental analysis, classification, translation…) to automatically improve their performance by incorporating some general word/sentence representations learned on the larger dataset.\n",
    "While unsupervised representation learning of sentences had been the norm for quite some time, last year has seen a shift toward supervised and multi-task learning schemes with a number of very interesting proposals in late 2017/early 2018.\n",
